# Sphere Demo

This is a simple Godot project to show how a rotating sphere can be rendered orthogonally in 2D.

The code is heavily commented, and should hopefully be understandable even if you are unfamiliar with Godot or GDScript.

Relevant files:
- [roll.gd](https://github.com/StellatedCUBE/SphereDemoThing/blob/main/roll.gd) - Moves and rotates the ball
- [ball.gdshader](https://github.com/StellatedCUBE/SphereDemoThing/blob/main/ball.gdshader) - Displays the ball

An online build of the project is available [here](https://tmp.shinten.moe/sphere-demo/).
