# Sphere Demo

This is a simple Godot project to show how a rotating sphere can be rendered orthogonally in 2D.

The code is heavily commented, and should hopefully be understandable even if you are unfamiliar with Godot or GDScript.

An online build of the project is available [here](https://tmp.shinten.moe/sphere-demo/).
